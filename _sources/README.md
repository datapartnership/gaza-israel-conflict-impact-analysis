> Using Alternative Data to Understand Economic Impacts of the Gaza-Israel 2023 Conflict

The Gaza-Israel 2023 Conflict has had profound economic implications that extend beyond conventional measures. This project aims to explore alternative data sources, such as synthetic-aperture radar and nighttime lights, to better comprehend the multifaceted economic impacts on the Gaza Strip. Leveraging alternative data sources can provide a more nuanced understanding of the economic landscape during and after such events, when traditional economic indicators may not fully capture the complex dynamics and localized effects of conflicts.
